title: An Introduction to Blogging
---

It's a really good feeling to be proud of something.

If we're not counting breaks, it took me just about half of a day to set up this blog. Of course, it wasn't as if I made the whole thing from *scratch* – using Barry Clark's [jekyll-now](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) guide, I simply duplicated his repository and got to work customizing it to be the blog you see right now. And it looks really, really *good*, I think! And I'm really proud of the way it looks and feels to **just use**.

I took a lot of inspiration from [Constanza Yovaniniz's blog](http://blog.kurisquare.com/), actually – Yovaniniz, as a comic artist and grad student, focuses a lot on the topic of productivity methods (and recently, minimalism), so she tends to keep her work very **simple and efficient**, whether it be her art style or her blog design. 

Through email, I asked Coni what she used to create her blog, and it turns out she used Wordpress, which is a spectacularly popular tool for making websites and blogs and the such! Unfortunately, though, I learned a while ago that it wasn't really for me. It was much too complex than I'd like to use, and as a computer science student, *much too cumbersome* for my liking – especially since I had already set up my website with Github Pages, writing my own custom HTML and CSS from scratch. So a quick Google search later for "Github alternatives to Wordpress", I found Clark's guide for **a blog built with Jekyll on Github Pages**. Perfect!

One new repository named "blog" later, and here we are! A new blog, focused on getting out my ideas and thoughts in a very clean and easy fashion. It's still a work-in-progress, but I'm really happy and proud of the way it turned out. And honestly, that's more than I could have asked for.
